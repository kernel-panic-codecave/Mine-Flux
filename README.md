# Mine-Flux
Mine Flux API is a cross platform energy api that aims to bridge the gap between forge energy and fabric. The forge version is completely compatible with existing forge energy systems. the fabric version brings its own version of energy that behaves exactly the same way as the forge version.

 

The unit is MF and the conversion ratio is 1 MF = 1 FE = 1 RF
